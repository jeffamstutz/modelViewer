# ospDebugViewer
external version of the ospModelViewer from the ospray source tree

This project requires the CMake find_package config found in the 'devel' branch of OSPRay. An install of the 'devel'
branch of https://github.com/jeffamstutz/OSPRay will suffice until the CMake config changes make it into an offical
future release of OSPRay.
